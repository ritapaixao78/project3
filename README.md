# project3
As I told to Vrushank, due to lack of attention (I didn't read the pre requisites of the project) I generate my models based on knn as my idea it was to classify the crimes between summer and fall.
I tried to adapt it to linear regression but the results clearly are horrible as I am working only with booleans and not continuous data.
Vrushank asked me to try the project with another dataset called assessor, but I will not be able to deliver today.
I am sending my results based on SFPD occurences 2015 dataset, and I will try to deliver the results of the assessor analysis asap as a complement of this project.
