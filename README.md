# project3
As I told to Vrushank, due to lack of attention (I didn't read the pre requisites of the project) I generated my models based on knn as my idea it was to classify SF crimes between summer and fall and categories (solved and unsolved).
I tried to adapt it to linear regression but the results clearly are horrible as I am working only with booleans. I did not generate any continuous data.
Vrushank asked me to try the project again with another dataset called assessor, but I will not be able to deliver today.
I am sending my results based on SFPD occurences 2015 dataset, and I will try to deliver the results of the assessor analysis asap as a complement of this project.
